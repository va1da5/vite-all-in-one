# Vite - All In One

The repository contains an example of how to set up the Vite build system to embed CSS code into a Javascript bundle. This can be helpful when you want to include custom UI elements in third-party software solutions, such as Confluence, while utilizing open-source components from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) or other sources.
